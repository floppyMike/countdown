# demer
A dead simple commandline blocking timer.

## Why dead?
Simply I don't have infinite time to maintain what I write. So I strive for my code to be complete. Meaning I want it to be dead. But this involves it being extremely simple so don't expect many features. But at least it won't be a giant codebase with a dozen dependancies that can break or are insecure.

## How to use it
